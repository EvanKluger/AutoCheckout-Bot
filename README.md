# AutoCheckout-Bot

Hey guys.


This is a Repository with code for an AutoCheckout Bot. An Auto Checkout Bot is a "Bot" that auto performs a purchase from the Web without you needing to do anything except run the file and input Name, Address, Credit Card information, and other various data that are needed for the purchase.

Here is where we are at so far:


Best_Buy_Airpods.py -> Python code that uses Selenium to autocheckout A pair of AirPods 2nd Generation from Best Buy. 
The URLs and other buttons can be replaced to setup a code to buy a different product from any website.
